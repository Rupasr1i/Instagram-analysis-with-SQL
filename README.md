# Instagram-analysis-with-SQL


This GitHub repository contains an analysis of Instagram data with various categories and tables.
The project includes SQL queries to answer specific questions. 


## Introduction

In this project, I explore Instagram data to gain insights and answer specific questions using SQL queries.
This README provides an overview of the project's components and how to use them.

## Data

Our Instagram dataset contains information categorized into different tables, including user data, posts, comments,video,post likes, hashtags, hashtags_follows and login data. 
The data is stored in a relational database. 

### Categories

## SQL Queries

To gain insights from the Instagram data, we've written SQL queries to answer various questions, such as:

- Most followed hashtag
- Most Used Hashtags
- Most Inactive User
- Most Likes Posts
- Average post per user
- User Never Comment
- Followers > 40
- Any specific word in comment
- Most posts according location
- Most users according location
- Most bookmarks post
- Most bookmarks post by user
- Longest captions in post
- Which post got more likes

You can find these SQL queries in the [SQL Queries](http://surl.li/lsymk) directory.
